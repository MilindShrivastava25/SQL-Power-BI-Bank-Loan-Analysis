# Bank Loan Analysis 
## Project Overview

The Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of a bank’s lending activities and portfolio performance.
Using SQL Server, Power BI, and Excel, this project analyzes loan applications, repayment trends, and borrower health to support data-driven lending strategies.

The dashboard helps answer:

How many loan applications were received and approved?

How much funding has been disbursed and repaid?

What are the average interest rates and borrower DTI ratios?

How do loan performances vary across regions, terms, and purposes?

## Problem Statement

# Bank Loan Analysis â€“ SQL Documentation
## Overview

This section of the project focuses on the SQL-based data validation and analysis used to support the Bank Loan Analysis dashboard. The SQL scripts were designed to extract, transform, and validate key loan metrics before they were visualized in Power BI.

By running structured queries, we ensured that all KPI values in the dashboard are consistent with the raw dataset, increasing both reliability and transparency.

## Objectives of SQL Analysis

Calculate portfolio-wide KPIs such as total applications, total funded amount, total repayment, average interest rate, and average debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.

Track time-based metrics like Month-to-Date (MTD) and Previous Month-to-Date (PMTD) changes.

Segment loans into Good Loans vs. Bad Loans based on repayment status.

Provide granular breakdowns by loan attributes such as region, term length, employment history, purpose, and home ownership.

Establish a loan status grid for quick comparison of performance indicators across loan categories.
